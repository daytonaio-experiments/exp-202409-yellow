### Environment Performance Optimization

**Job to be Done:**

**When** developers need to ensure their development environments run efficiently,

**We want to** create an AI tool that monitors environment performance and suggests optimizations.

**So that** developers can maintain fast and resource-efficient environments, improving productivity and reducing costs.

### Objectives

1. **Performance Monitoring:** Collect metrics on CPU, memory, and I/O performance within development environments.
2. **Bottleneck Identification:** Analyze performance data to identify bottlenecks and resource-intensive processes.
3. **Optimization Suggestions:** Use historical data and AI to suggest performance optimizations, such as code changes, configuration tweaks (e.g., Docker resource limits), or hardware upgrades.
4. **Automated Adjustments:** Implement optional automated adjustments that can be applied with developer approval.

### High-Level Functional Specification for Environment Performance Optimization

#### Overview
